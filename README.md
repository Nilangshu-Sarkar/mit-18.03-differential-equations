# ⚙️ MIT 18.03SC — Differential Equations (Complete Notes & Problem Sets)

This repository contains my **complete, self-driven work** for **MIT 18.03SC: Differential Equations**, completed independently through a rigorous combination of analytical methods, qualitative reasoning, and system-level understanding.

The emphasis throughout is on **structure, behavior, and interpretation of solutions**, rather than rote techniques or isolated computations.

## 📘 Course Overview

**MIT 18.03SC** studies differential equations as a unified language for describing **dynamic processes**. The course moves beyond individual solution tricks to develop a coherent understanding of how systems evolve over time, both linearly and nonlinearly.

Core themes include:
- Modeling physical and abstract systems with ODEs
- Qualitative behavior of solutions
- Linear systems and state-space formulation
- Nonlinear dynamics and linearization
- Stability, robustness, and limitations of approximation methods

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by major conceptual units of **MIT 18.03SC**, with each unit containing:

- 📄 **Clean, self-written LaTeX solutions**
- ✏️ **Full derivations with no skipped logic**
- 🧠 **Selective problem coverage** (routine exercises omitted)
- 📐 **Geometric and qualitative explanations alongside algebra**

Each unit typically includes:
- Final compiled PDFs
- Source LaTeX files
- Minimal sketches only where conceptually necessary

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Philosophy

This work follows these guiding principles:

- **Behavior before formulas** — understand what solutions do before computing them
- **Systems perspective** — equations treated as dynamical objects
- **Selective rigor** — problems chosen to maximize conceptual coverage
- **Qualitative reasoning valued equally with computation**
- **Closure-driven study** — each topic taken to completion before moving on

The goal was not volume, but **conceptual exhaustion** of the course material.

## 🧪 Mathematical Maturity Emphasis

Special attention is given to:

- **When solution methods apply — and when they fail**
- **What linearization can and cannot predict**
- **Robust vs non-robust behavior**
- **Equivalence between algebraic, geometric, and system-level views**
- **Why certain behaviors are impossible within given constraints**

These aspects are essential for advanced work in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

This repository serves as:

- A **personal mathematical record**
- A **reference for differential equations and dynamical systems**
- A **foundation for advanced coursework** (mechanics, E&M, control, nonlinear dynamics)
- Evidence of **independent mastery**, not classroom completion

The intent was to fully internalize the ideas of the course, not merely finish assignments.

## 🏁 Final Note

This repository represents a **closed chapter in formal study**, but not an endpoint.

The ideas developed here reappear throughout:
- Classical and analytical mechanics
- Electromagnetism and field theory
- Control systems
- Nonlinear dynamics and applied mathematics

This work prioritizes **understanding that lasts**, not short-term performance.
